    "**Objective(Background)**\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the data science team in this company, I have been assigned to develop a predictive model aimed at streamlining and supporting the efforts of the marketing team. Currently, the marketing team spends a significant amount of time manually identifying potential loan approvals, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. The goal of this predictive model is to allow the marketing team to focus solely on applicants who are most likely to have their loans approved, based on data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the model, applicants predicted to be approved can receive more attention, while those predicted to be not approved can be deprioritized. This approach ensures that the marketing team doesn't waste valuable time on low-probability candidates, allowing them to increase efficiency, improve decision-making, and ultimately drive more successful loan conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This predictive system will reduce the workload of the marketing team, enabling them to focus their efforts on high-quality leads and boosting overall productivity and ROI for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data source consists of information about individual applicant details, financial metrics, and loan-specific factors. You can view the data using this [link]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itshappy/ps4e9-original-data-loan-approval-prediction').\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains 32,581 entries across 12 columns with 7 numerical colums, 4 categorical columns and 1 column as target.\n",
    "\n",
    " Columns | Data Type | Decription\n",
    " ---|---|---\n",
    " person_age | Int | Applicant's age in years.\n",
    " person_income | Float | Annual income of the applicant in USD.\n",
    " person_home_ownership | Object | Status of homeownership.\n",
    " person_emp_length | Float | Length of employment in years.\n",
    " loan_intent | Object | Purpose of the loan.\n",
    " loan_grade | Object | Risk grade assigned to the loan, assessing the applicant's creditworthiness.\n",
    " loan_amnt | Float | Total loan amount requested by the applicant.\n",
    " loan_int_rate | Float | Interest rate associated with the loan.\n",
    " loan_status (target) | Object | The approval status of the loan(approved or not approved).\n",
    " loan_percent_income | Float | Percentage of the applicant's income allocated towards loan repayment.\n",
    " cb_person_default_on_file | Object | Indicates if the applicant has a history of default ('Y' for yes, 'N' for no).\n",
    " cb_person_cred_hist_length | Int | Length of the applicant's credit history in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on individual applicant details, financial metrics, and loan-specific factors. This model will support the marketing team by focusing on applicants with a higher likelihood of loan approval, reducing time spent on low-probability cases. The model’s performance will be measured by achieving a recall score of at least 90%, ensuring the majority of potential approvals are identified. Leveraging the existing dataset of 32,581 records, the data science team will preprocess the data, handle missing values, and apply machine learning algorithms to meet the target recall. This project is essential for improving marketing efficiency and increasing loan conversions, with the model being developed, tested, and deployed within a 1-week.\n",

    "From the data above, we can get insight:\n",
    "1. The average age of the applicants is 27 years, with a minimum age of 20 and a maximum age of 144. This likely indicates that the target applicants are individuals who may not yet have permanent jobs or homes. However, since the standard deviation is quite high for this attribute, further analysis is needed to obtain clearer insights. This suggests an outlier in the maximum age, as it exceeds 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The average income of the applicants is $66,000, with a minimum income of $4,000 and a maximum income of $6,000,000. This suggests that applicants with lower incomes are less likely to apply for loans, as the lower quartile of the data is $38,500. We can conclude that applicants applying for loans tend to have higher incomes. Given the wide range of income values, there are likely many outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The average work length of the applicants is 4 years, with a minimum of 0 years and a maximum of 123 years. This suggests a wide variety of applicants, ranging from new employees to those with many years of experience. However, since the standard deviation is quite high for this attribute, further analysis is needed to obtain clearer insights. The maximum work length also indicates an outlier, as it exceeds 100 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The average loan amount requested by applicants is around $9,500, with a minimum loan of $500 and a maximum of $35,000. The range of loan amounts spans from $500 to $35,000. The wide range in loan amounts suggests that applicants have varying financial needs, from small personal loans to larger, more substantial loan requests. The average loan of $9,500 indicates that many applicants may be seeking mid-range loans, possibly for personal expenses or small investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The average interest rate on loans requested by applicants is around 11%, with a minimum interest rate of 5% and a maximum of 23%. The average interest rate of 11% suggests that the loans being requested fall within a moderate to slightly high range, which may reflect the credit risk associated with the applicant pool. The minimum interest rate of 5% could indicate that some applicants are receiving competitive rates, possibly due to strong creditworthiness, while the maximum rate of 23% may signify higher-risk applicants who are likely being charged more due to perceived risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The average percentage of income allocated to loan repayment is around 17%, with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 83%. The average of 17% suggests that most applicants are committing a moderate portion of their income to loan repayments, which could indicate a manageable debt burden for many. However, the wide range, especially the maximum of 83%, points to a subset of applicants who are dedicating a substantial portion of their income to loan repayments. This could be a potential red flag for loan approval, as a high debt-to-income ratio often increases the likelihood of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The average credit history length for applicants is around 6 years, with a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 30 years. The average of 6 years indicates that many applicants have a relatively short credit history, which may reflect a younger or less experienced borrower base. The maximum length of 30 years suggests that there are also applicants with long-established credit histories, potentially signifying more financially stable or experienced borrowers. Applicants with shorter credit histories might face more difficulty in obtaining loan approvals, as lenders often view a longer credit history as a sign of reliability."

    "From the data above, we can get insight:\n",
    "1. Most of the applicants' home ownership status is renting.\n",
    "    - This suggests that a significant portion of applicants might not have accumulated enough wealth to purchase a home, potentially indicating younger individuals or those in the earlier stages of their careers. Renting could also reflect financial instability, which might influence loan approval decisions, as homeownership is often seen as a sign of financial security.\n",
    "2. Most applicants cite education as the reason for their loan.\n",
    "    - This trend indicates that a large number of applicants are likely seeking loans to finance their education, which could mean many borrowers are students or individuals looking to upskill. Education loans can be seen as an investment in future earning potential, but lenders may also consider the current income and repayment ability of these applicants.\n",
    "3. Most of the applicants' loan grade is A.\n",
    "    - A loan grade of A suggests that many applicants are perceived as low-risk borrowers, based on factors like credit history, income, and overall financial stability. This could indicate that the applicant pool contains individuals with strong financial profiles, which would lead to a higher likelihood of loan approval and potentially lower interest rates.\n",
    "4. Most of the applicants have no history of default or credit.\n",
    "    - A lack of default history indicates that many applicants have a clean credit record, making them attractive candidates for loan approvals. This suggests that the applicant pool is generally composed of responsible borrowers who have managed their credit well, reducing the risk for lenders."

This suggests that applicants with higher incomes are less likely to have their loans approved, which might indicate that higher-income individuals either apply for riskier loans or that the model may favor lower-income applicants for approval. The correlation is significant with a p-value of 0.00.\n",

    "Based on the graph, we can get insight:\n",
    "- There are six types of loan intents: education, medical, venture, personal, debt consolidation, and home improvement.\n",
    "- The most common loan intent is education, accounting for 19.81% of the data, while the least common is home improvement, at 11.06%.\n",
    "- The breakdown for the other intents is as follows: medical at 18.63%, venture at 17.55%, personal at 16.95%, and debt consolidation at 16%.\n",
    "- The high percentage of education-related loans suggests that a significant portion of applicants are using loans to invest in their education, potentially indicating younger individuals seeking to finance their studies. On the other hand, home improvement loans being the least common could suggest that fewer applicants are homeowners or that home renovation is a lower priority for the applicant pool. The relatively even distribution among the remaining intents (medical, venture, personal, and debt consolidation) indicates that applicants seek loans for various personal and financial reasons, with no single category dominating the others by a large margin."

    "The histogram of loan amount distributions does not indicate that larger loans are more likely to be approved. In fact, smaller to mid-sized loans (around $5,000 to $15,000) seem to have more approvals, while larger loans (above $15,000) show a decreasing approval rate. The approval proportion for larger loans is much smaller compared to mid-sized loans. This suggests that the bank may perceive larger loans as higher risk, or applicants seeking larger loans may not meet the required creditworthiness criteria as frequently. Therefore, mid-sized loans have a better approval rate than larger loans."

Specifically, the average income for approved loans is approximately $50,000, while for not approved loans, it is around $70,000. This suggests that individuals with higher income levels may have a lower likelihood of loan approval, which could indicate that other factors, such as creditworthiness or financial history, play a significant role in the approval process."

    "            - These features have low cardinality and no intrinsic order among the categories (e.g., the categories in person_home_ownership such as \"rent\" and \"own\" have no inherent ranking). Therefore, OneHotEncoder is appropriate as it creates binary columns for each category, allowing the model to treat each category equally without assuming any ordinal relationship.\n",
    "        - LabelEncoder for `cb_person_default_on_file`:\n",
    "            - This feature is binary (typically 'Y' or 'N' indicating whether a person has defaulted on a loan). LabelEncoder is ideal for such cases, as it converts these two categories into 0 and 1, which is efficient for binary categorical data and fits well with most machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "        - OrdinalEncoder for `loan_grade`:\n",
    "            - The loan_grade feature has a natural order (e.g., A > B > C > D, etc.), which makes OrdinalEncoder a good choice. This encoder preserves the ordinal relationship between categories by mapping them to integers that reflect their ranking, allowing the model to understand and leverage this ordered structure.\n",

For example, if the recorded age is 120, adjusting it to 20 makes it more realistic. This assumes that the original data entry was likely a mistake, such as typing \"120\" instead of \"20\".\n",
    "- Similarly, for person_emp_length, an employment length over 100 years is highly unlikely. Reducing such values by 100 can convert unrealistic lengths (e.g., an entry of 150 years of employment to 50 years) into a more reasonable figure. This approach assumes that an erroneous input resulted in the inflated number, and the intention was likely to convey a much shorter employment history.\n"

    "Based on the performance metrics provided for KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting, here's an analysis of their results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train Recall\n",
    "    - Decision Tree, Random Forest: All have a perfect recall of 1.0 on the training set, indicating they classify all training instances correctly. This is a strong indicator of overfitting, as these models are likely memorizing the training data rather than generalizing from it.\n",
    "    - KNN (0.902), SVM (0.859) and Boosting(0.82): These models have lower recall values on the training set, suggesting they generalize better and are less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "2. Cross-Validation Recall\n",
    "    - Random Forest (0.866): This model performs the best in cross-validation, indicating that it maintains a good balance between complexity and generalization.\n",
    "    - KNN (0.851), SVM (0.849) and Boosting (0.82) : The models perform similarly, showing consistent performance across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "    - Decision Tree (0.846): This model has the lowest cross-validation recall, indicating it might be less robust across various data samples despite their perfect training recall.\n",
    "3. Test Recall\n",
    "    - SVM (0.731) and Boosting (0.76): These models have the highest test recall, suggesting it generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "    - Random Forest (0.717): Follows closely behind, indicating it also performs well on the test set.\n",
    "    - KNN (0.706): Slightly lower but still decent recall, suggesting reasonable generalization.\n",
    "    - Decision Tree (0.704): This model shows the lowest test recall, reflecting potential overfitting since they performed perfectly on the training set but fail to maintain that performance on the test set.\n",
    "4. AUC Score\n",
    "    - Random Forest (0.900): This model has the highest AUC score, which indicates it is effective at distinguishing between positive and negative classes on unseen data.\n",
    "    - SVM (0.897): Also performs very well, showing it has a strong predictive power.\n",
    "    - KNN (0.864) and Boosting (0.85): Displays good performance, but lower than Random Forest and SVM.\n",
    "    - Decision Tree (0.776): Both have the lowest AUC scores, reinforcing the overfitting trend observed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Insights:\n",
    "    - Overfitting in Tree-Based Models: The Decision Tree, and Random Forest show perfect recall on the training set but lower performance on the test set. This indicates they might be memorizing the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. It is advisable to apply techniques such as pruning (for Decision Trees) or tuning hyperparameters (like max_depth or n_estimators for Random Forest) to mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - SVM's Strong Generalization: The SVM model performs best on the test recall (0.731) and has a high AUC score (0.897), suggesting it generalizes well to unseen data. This model seems to be a good choice based on its performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Boosting's Solid Performance: With an AUC score of 0.851, Boosting ranks just behind SVM and Random Forest in its ability to distinguish between classes. This indicates that Boosting performs well in ranking positive instances above negative ones but falls short of being the top model. While Boosting does not outperform SVM or Random Forest, it remains a strong second choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Random Forest's Balanced Performance: Random Forest is notable for having the highest AUC score (0.900) while maintaining a good balance between training and test recall. Its performance indicates it is effective for this dataset and can be a reliable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - KNN's Reliable Performance: KNN shows a reasonable balance between performance metrics, with good training, cross-validation, and test recall. Its AUC score is also decent, suggesting it could be a viable option, particularly for simpler decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Decision Trees Underperform: Decision Trees exhibit strong overfitting. They perform excellently on training data but poorly on unseen data. Tuning hyperparameters is crucial to improve their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of our models, we have determined that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most suitable choice for further development. The SVM model demonstrated the highest test recall at 0.731 and an impressive AUC score of 0.897, indicating its strong ability to generalize to unseen data and effectively distinguish between classes. By focusing on hyperparameter tuning, we aim to improve our model’s performance even more, ensuring that it not only meets but exceeds our objectives in accurately predicting outcomes."

    "    - Cross-Validation Recall improved slightly (from 0.849 to 0.856) after tuning. This indicates that the model's ability to generalize across different training-validation splits improved, meaning it handles unseen data during cross-validation slightly better.\n",
    "    - However, Test Recall dropped from 0.731 to 0.72, which suggests the model might be slightly overfitting to the validation folds or not fully capturing the patterns in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Overfitting Potential:\n",
    "    - Train recall for Class 1 improved from 0.858 to 0.87 after tuning. However, this improvement didn’t translate to better test recall (it actually dropped). This could indicate overfitting, where the model is learning the training data too well but failing to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Business Impact on Marketing Team:\n",
    "    - The current model identifies 72% of true loan approvals, meaning that 28% of potential loan approvals are being missed. These missed approvals represent lost opportunities for loan conversions, directly impacting the marketing team’s ability to efficiently target high-probability applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Long-Term Financial Growth and Sustainability\n",
    "    - The model’s ability to consistently identify approved loans contributes to the long-term growth of the bank’s loan portfolio. With a higher recall, the bank can scale its loan products and tap into new customer segments by targeting more applicants who are likely to get approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. High AUC Score: \n",
    "    - Both AUC scores indicate that the model has a strong ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes (i.e., approved and rejected loans). An AUC of 0.898 suggests excellent performance, as it is very close to 1, which would indicate perfect discrimination.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Applicant Demographics and Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Age: Most applicants are aged between 20 and 30 years, indicating a younger demographic that may lack stable financial backgrounds, such as permanent jobs or homeownership.\n",
    "    - Income: The average income is around $66,000, with a broad range from $4,000 to $6,000,000. Applicants with lower incomes are less likely to apply for loans, and outliers indicate high-income individuals are included.\n",
    "    - Employment Length: The average employment length is around 4 years, with many applicants having short employment histories, which might affect their perceived stability.\n",
    "    - Home Ownership: Most applicants are renters (50.48%), followed by those with mortgages (41.26%). Only 7.93% own their homes outright, suggesting a younger or less financially stable applicant pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loan Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Loan Amount: The average loan requested is $9,500, with amounts ranging from $500 to $35,000. Mid-sized loans (around $5,000 to $15,000) are more likely to be approved, while larger loans (above $15,000) show fewer approvals.\n",
    "    - Loan Interest Rates: The average interest rate is 11%, with a range from 5% to 23%. Higher interest rates correlate with a greater likelihood of loan approval.\n",
    "    - Loan Grade: The majority of applicants fall into loan grades A and B, indicating low risk. Only a small percentage of applicants are in the higher-risk categories (D, E, F, and G).\n",
    "    - Loan Purpose: Most loans are for education (19.81%), followed by medical expenses, personal reasons, and debt consolidation, which suggests a diverse pool of loan intents.\n",
    "    - Debt-to-Income Ratio: The average percentage of income allocated to loan repayment is around 17%. However, some applicants allocate up to 83%, indicating a risk of over-leveraging.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creditworthiness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Credit History: The average credit history length is 6 years, with a weak negative correlation to loan approval. Longer credit histories may slightly reduce the likelihood of approval.\n",
    "    - Default History: Most applicants have no history of default, making them low-risk borrowers. This likely contributes to the predominance of applicants with loan grades A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loan Approval Trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Approval Rate: Only 21.82% of loans are approved, with the remaining 78.18% being rejected. This highly imbalanced data indicates a conservative loan approval process.\n",
    "    - Correlations with Loan Approval:\n",
    "        - Income: A moderate negative correlation between income and loan approval suggests that higher-income applicants are less likely to be approved, potentially due to applying for riskier loans.\n",
    "        - Loan Amount & Interest Rate: Larger loans and those with higher interest rates are more likely to be approved, potentially as a way to offset the risk of approving higher-risk applicants.\n",
    "        - Debt-to-Income Ratio: Loans with higher debt-to-income ratios are more likely to be approved, indicating that the bank is willing to approve loans for individuals dedicating more of their income to repayment."
